# State Management in React

## What is State Management ?

**"State" is any data that describes the current behavior of an application.** This could include values like "a list of objects fetched from the server", "which item is currently selected", "name of the currently logged-in user", and "is this modal open?".

**State** allows you to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces. By managing the state of component, you can update the UI in response to user interactions, API calls, or other events.

Here are different types for state management that will be covered in our example:

- **Local State:** Data we manage in one or another component e.g handling inputs data in from.

- **Server State:** Data are fetched from the server via an API and cached on the client, there are a couple of great libraries that make data fetching in React a breeze such as: **_React Query_**.

### Let's break down the state management code example:

<DemoLink to="/state-management/preview/ServerStateExample">View Demo</DemoLink>

<ServerStateDoc />

<div style={{ height: 300 }} />
