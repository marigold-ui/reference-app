When comparing the two implementations, one notable difference is how the tabs are defined and organized.

In the first implementation, the tabs are passed as an array of objects directly to the `<Tabs>` component,
with each object containing a `title` and `content` property. While this approach works for small examples,
it can become difficult to maintain as the content structure grows larger and more complex. Using a
"data object" for the tabs' content goes against the intended use of JSX, which is designed for
building component structures in a declarative way.

```tsx TabsCompoundComponent.tsx
// from ./TabsExample.tsx 8:45
```

In contrast, the second implementation, which uses compound components, organizes the tabs into `<Tabs.Item>`
components within a `<Tabs.List>` component and associates each tab with its respective content panel
using `<Tabs.Panel>` components. This approach provides better separation of concerns and encapsulates
the logic more effectively.

By splitting the logic into distinct components, the code becomes more readable and easier to manage. Each
component has a specific responsibility, making it clear how the tabs and their content are related. This
aligns much better with the principles of JSX and React's component-based architecture.
