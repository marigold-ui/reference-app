```

When comparing the two implementations, one notable difference is how the tabs are defined and organized.
In the implementation on the right, the tabs are passed as an array of objects directly to the `<Tabs>`
component, with each object containing a `title` and `content`property.

---

```tsx TabsCompoundComponent.tsx
// from ./TabsExample.tsx 8:45
```

On the other hand, the second implementation separates the tabs into `<Tabs.Item>` components within a
`<Tabs.List>` component and associates each tab with its respective content panel using `<Tabs.Panel>`
components.

This implementation offers better separation of concerns and encapsulation of logic. It allows for more
explicit and readable code, as each component is responsible for its own specific functionality.
Additionally, the use of compound components makes it easier to understand the relationship between
the tabs and their content panels.
