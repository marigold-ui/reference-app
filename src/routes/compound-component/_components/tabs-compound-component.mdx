```tsx TabContext.tsx focus=3:8
// from ./Tabs/Context.tsx
```

### Setup State

To share the state and provide methods to update it, we are going to use [React's Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)
feature. This approach allows us to provide the state to multiple components without the need for [prop drilling](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/prop-drilling-in-react-explained-with-examples/).
By doing so, we make the composition of our components more flexible and easier to maintain.

In our case, the context will hold the active tab (`activeTab`), represented by a string identifier, and a function (`setActiveTab`), which updates the currently active tab.

---

```tsx focus=6:11
// from ./Tabs/Tabs.tsx
```

Let's begin our refactoring with the parent component. This component will manage the state of the tabs
and provide methods to update it as needed.
