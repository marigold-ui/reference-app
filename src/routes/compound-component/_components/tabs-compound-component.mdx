```tsx TabContext.tsx focus=3:8
// from ./Tabs/Context.tsx
```

### Setup State

To share the state and provide methods to update it, we are going to use [React's Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)
feature. This approach allows us to provide the state to multiple components without the need for
[prop drilling](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/prop-drilling-in-react-explained-with-examples/).

In our case, the context will hold the active tab (`activeTab`), represented by a string identifier, and a
function (`setActiveTab`), which updates the currently active tab.

---

```tsx TabContext.tsx focus=10:22
// from ./Tabs/Context.tsx
```

### Accessing State

Now that we have created our context, we need a way for the child components to access it. This will be managed by the `<TabsContextProvider>`,
which the parent component will use and wrap around its children. The child components can then access the context using the custom `useTabsContext` hook.

---

```tsx Tabs.tsx focus=9:22
// from ./Tabs/Tabs.tsx
```

### Parent Component

Like mentioned in the previous step, the main concern of the parent component (`<Tabs>`) is to provide its children with the context.
Additionally, it will take care of visually separating the list of tabs from the content.

Note that this implementation of `<Tabs>` also allows setting a tab that is active when the component first renders (`defaultActiveTab`).
This feature is an improvement over the previous implementation, where the first tab would always be displayed. This makes the component not only more customizable,
but also more robust to use since you can ensure that the specified tab actually exists.

---

### All-In-One Import

```tsx Tabs.tsx focus=24:26
// from ./Tabs/Tabs.tsx
```

The `<Tabs>` component exposes all its children using dot notation. This approach groups related components together under
the `Tabs` namespace, allowing us to import all relevant components with a single import. This method helps organize related components,
making it easy to identify and use them cohesively. Additionally, this structure makes the API more intuitive,
as all related functionality is grouped logically.

---

```tsx TabList.tsx
// from ./Tabs/TabList.tsx
```

### `<Tab.List>`

Let's take a peek at the first of the child components, `<Tab.List>`. Its main job is pretty straightforward: to line up the `<Tab.Item>`s
in a horizontal list, and that's it!

---

```tsx TabItem.tsx
// from ./Tabs/TabItem.tsx
```

### `<Tab.Item>`

The next child component, `<Tab.Item>`, is a bit more interesting! Its role is to represent each individual tab within our tabs component.
It receives a unique identifier (`id`), which serves as a reference to a corresponding `<Tab.Panel>`, and the familiar `children`
prop that allows us to display the tab title in any way we want.

Reading from the context via the `useTabsContext` hook, the `<Tab.Item>` will set a `[data-active]` attribute when the `activeTab` is set to its `id`. This will apply some addition CSS highlighing the `<Tab.Item>` visually as currently active tab.
