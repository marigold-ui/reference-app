### Sharing State and Logic

To achieve this, we are going to use [React's Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) feature.
This allows us to share the state and functions across multiple components without prop drilling, making
the composition of our components more flexible and easier to maintain.

```tsx focus=6:11
// from ./Tabs/Tabs.tsx
```

Let's begin our refactoring with the parent component. This component will manage the state of the tabs
and provide methods to update it as needed.
