```tsx TabContext.tsx focus=3:8
// from ./Tabs/Context.tsx
```

### Setup State

To share the state and provide methods to update it, we are going to use [React's Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)
feature. This approach allows us to provide the state to multiple components without the need for
[prop drilling](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/prop-drilling-in-react-explained-with-examples/).

In our case, the context will hold the active tab (`activeTab`), represented by a string identifier, and a
function (`setActiveTab`), which updates the currently active tab.

---

```tsx TabContext.tsx focus=10:22
// from ./Tabs/Context.tsx
```

### Accessing State

Now that we have created our context, we need a way for the child components to access it. This will be managed by the `<TabsContextProvider>`,
which the parent component will use and wrap around its children. The child components can then access the context using the custom `useTabsContext` hook.

---

```tsx Tabs.tsx focus=9:22
// from ./Tabs/Tabs.tsx
```

### Parent Component

Like mentioned in the previous step, the main concern of the parent component (`<Tabs>`) is to provide its children with the context.
Additionally, it will take care of visually separating the list of tabs from the content.

Note that this implementation of `<Tabs>` also allows setting a tab that is active when the component first renders (`defaultActiveTab`).
This feature is an improvement over the previous implementation, where the first tab would always be displayed. This makes the component not only more customizable,
but also more robust to use since you can ensure that the specified tab actually exists.

---

### All-In-One Import

```tsx Tabs.tsx focus=24:26
// from ./Tabs/Tabs.tsx
```

The `<Tabs>` component exposes all its children using dot notation. This approach groups related components together under
the `Tabs` namespace, allowing us to import all relevant components with a single import. This method helps organize related components,
making it easy to identify and use them cohesively. Additionally, this structure makes the API more intuitive,
as all related functionality is grouped logically.

---

```tsx TabList.tsx
// from ./Tabs/TabList.tsx
```

### `<Tab.List>`

Let's take a peek at the first of the child components, `<Tab.List>`. Its main job is pretty straightforward: to line up the `<Tab.Item>`s
in a horizontal list, and that's it!

---

```tsx TabItem.tsx
// from ./Tabs/TabItem.tsx
```

### `<Tab.Item>`

The next child component, `<Tab.Item>`, is a bit more interesting! Its role is to represent each individual tab within our tabs component.
It receives a unique identifier (`id`), which serves as a reference to a corresponding `<Tab.Panel>`, and the familiar `children`
prop that allows us to display the tab title in any way we want.

---

```tsx TabItem.tsx focus=15:16
// from ./Tabs/TabItem.tsx
```

### Active Tab

The `<Tab.Item>` component is responsible for highlighting and updating the currently active tab. It reads from the context using the
`useTabsContext` hook to determine if it should be highlighted as the active tab. This is done by setting a `[data-active]` attribute
when the `activeTab` matches its `id`. This part of the implementation did not change, except that we read the active tab from the
context rather than the parent props.

To change the active tab, an `onClick` listener is added to the component. When clicked, it updates the shared state via the context,
triggering a re-render to reflect the new active tab.

---

```tsx TabPanel.tsx
// from ./Tabs/TabPanel.tsx
```

### `<Tab.Panel>`

The job of the `<Tab.Panel>` component is to display its content only when its `id` matches the `id` of the currently active tab.
When this condition is met, it renders its `children`; otherwise, it renders nothing (`null`). This ensures that only the content
of the active tab is displayed while the rest remains hidden.
