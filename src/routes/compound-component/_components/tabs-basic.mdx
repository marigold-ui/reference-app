### Component Interface

For the component's interface, we define a prop called `tabs`, which holds all the information
to be displayed in the tabs. This prop accepts an array of objects, each with a `title` and
`content` property. The `title` is used for the tab label, while the `content` contains what will
be displayed when the related tab is active.

Both properties are `ReactNode`, meaning they can be any renderable React content, not just
strings but also other components. This flexibility is important as it allows the title and
content to be highly customizable, accommodating arbitrary contents.

```tsx focus=9

```

### Managing the active Tab

To remember the active tab (the one that is currently displayed), we use the `useState` hook.
This hook is perfect for our case because we only need to store the index of the active tab. The
component will display the first tab by default (index 0). We'll later read and update this state
based on user interactions.

If we wanted to, we could make this configurable by adding another prop to the component interface,
like `defaultActive`. However, for brevity, we will focus on the current implementation.

---

```tsx focus=13:24

```

### Render Tab Titles

Next, we start rendering the tab titles (`tab.title`) by iterating over the given `tabs` prop using the `.map` method.
This allows us to dynamically create a tab header for each item in the `tabs` array.

For styling purposes, we wrap the list of tab titles in a `div`. As seen before, we want to display the tabs in a horizontal line.

---

```tsx focus=18

```

### Highlighting the active Tab

There are different ways to implement how to highlight the active tab. We've decided to use a data property here. This
has the benefit that we can easily style the active tab title via CSS (`data-[active]:`), while also making debugging easier since
the data attributes are visible in the DOM and can be inspected.

In order to test if the current tab corresponds with our state of the active tab, we compare the `activeIndex` state with the index
of each tab during rendering. If they match, we apply the appropriate styling to indicate that the tab is active.

---

```tsx focus=19

```

### Change the active Tab

The titles need to do is allow the user to switch the active tab. We achieve this by listening for the click
event on the tab title. When a user clicks (or tabs) on a title, the `onClick` handler updates the state to its index, which will
then cause the component to update itself and display the corresponding tab content.

---

```tsx focus=25

```

### Render the active Tab's Content

Lastly, the component renders the content of the active tab (`activeTab.content`) in another `div` element. When the active tab
is changed and the state is updated, React will automatically update the content displayed for us.

If you are wondering what the exclamation mark (!) after `tabs[activeIndex]` does, this is a TypeScript non-null assertion operator. It tells TypeScript that you are
confident that `tabs[activeIndex]` will not be `null` or `undefined` at that point in the code.

In simple terms, it's used here to assure TypeScript that `tabs[activeIndex]` definitely exists and its `content` property can be safely accessed. This
helps avoid potential type errors during compilation.
