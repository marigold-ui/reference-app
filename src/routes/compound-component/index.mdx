In our application, we often encounter components that rely on each other, sharing state and logic. This
reliance can lead to challenges in managing state, ensuring consistent behavior, and maintaining clean,
organized code. To address these challenges and facilitate a well-structured, reusable, and
customizable API design, React uses a pattern called compound components.

Remember the `<select>` element in HTML with its `<option>` children? Compound components work similarly but
are more powerful and flexible. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use this pattern to build customizable
and versatility components.

```html
<select>
  <option value="pizza">Pizza</option>
  <option value="sushi">Sushi</option>
  <option value="soup">Soup</option>
</select>
```

## Benefits

Compound components allow you to group related child components within a single parent component. Each child
component has its own role, but they all work together to perform a specific function, like building a dropdown
menu or other complex UI elements. This pattern not only makes your components more modular and reusable but also
simplifies the composition and internal logic of your UI.

Explore the versatility and benefits of this pattern in the following tutorial.

## Benefits

One of the main benefits of compound components is their ability to enhance customization. By exposing specific
props or methods from the parent component, you can give users detailed control over how the compound component
looks and behaves. This means users can adjust the component to meet their needs without changing its core code.

Additionally, grouping related components within a single parent improves code organization and maintainability.
It makes the structure and dependencies of the compound component easier to understand, which helps developers
collaborate and reduces the risk of mistakes when making changes.

In short:

- **Encapsulation and Reusability:** They allow encapsulating related components, making the parent component more reusable and modular.
- **Customizability:** Each child component can be individually customized without exposing numerous customization props through the parent component.
- **Simplicity in State Management:** A well-designed compound component should require minimal state management, making the component easier to understand and maintain.

!!! example for a compound component marigold's select, e.g. the "disabledKeys" API! this is better on the parent, so you don't have to continously check if the item is disabled. this job is done by the components internally!

## Use-Cases and Examples

### Example 1: `<select>` and `<option>` in HTML

A similiar example in HTML are the `<select>` and `<option>` tags:

```html select.html
<select>
  <option value="pizza">Pizza</option>
  <option value="sushi">Sushi</option>
  <option value="soup">Soup</option>
</select>
```

The select tag works together with the option tag which is used for a drop-down menu to select items in HTML. Here the `<select>` manages the state of the UI, then the `<option>` elements are configured on how the `<select>` should work.

### Example 2: Building a compound component

<DemoLink to="/compound-component/preview/breadcrumbs">View Demo</DemoLink>

E-commerce websites often have “breadcrumbs” to help the user navigate to parent/grand-parent pages. For example:

`Electronics / Cell Phones / Cases`

---

<BreadcrumbDoc />
<div style={{ height: 100 }} />

### Example 3: Compound component with Context

<DemoLink to="/compound-component/preview/tabs">View Demo</DemoLink>

By leveraging React context, we can provide the necessary states and functions to child components without exposing them through props, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.

<TabsDoc />
<div style={{ height: 300 }} />
