# Compound Components

</Caption>

Compound components represent a powerful design pattern where a group of related child components are encapsulated within a single parent component.
This encapsulation enables the creation of reusable and flexible component suites that can be easily customized and composed to suit various needs.

By structuring components in this way, developers can achieve a higher level of abstraction, simplifying the internal composition of complex UI elements.
Instead of directly rendering individual child components, the parent component acts as a container, managing the relationship and behavior between them.

Explore the versatility and benefits of this pattern in the following tutorial.

## Benefits

One of the key benefits of compound components is their ability to enhance customization. By exposing specific props or methods from the parent component,
developers can provide users with granular control over the appearance and behavior of the compound component. This empowers users to tailor the component
to their specific requirements without needing to modify its underlying implementation.

Moreover, the encapsulation of related components within a single parent promotes code organization and maintainability. Developers can easily understand
the structure and dependencies of the compound component, facilitating collaboration and reducing the risk of unintended side effects when making changes.

## Importance of the Pattern

Compound components are important for several reasons:

- **Encapsulation and Reusability:** They allow encapsulating related components, making the parent component more reusable and modular.

- **Customizability:** Each child component can be individually customized without exposing numerous customization props through the parent component.

- **Simplicity in State Management:** A well-designed compound component should require minimal state management, making the component easier to understand and maintain.

## Use-Cases and Examples

### Example 1: `<select>` and `<option>` in HTML

A similiar example in HTML are the `<select>` and `<option>` tags:

    ```html select.html
        <select>
            <option value="pizza">Pizza</option>
            <option value="sushi">Sushi</option>
            <option value="soup">Soup</option>
        </select>
    ```

The select tag works together with the option tag which is used for a drop-down menu to select items in HTML. Here the `<select>` manages the state of the UI, then the `<option>` elements are configured on how the `<select>` should work.

### Example 2: Building a compound component

<DemoLink to="/compound-component/preview/breadcrumbs">View Demo</DemoLink>

E-commerce websites often have “breadcrumbs” to help the user navigate to parent/grand-parent pages. For example:

`Electronics / Cell Phones / Cases`

---

<BreadcrumbDoc />
<div style={{ height: 100 }} />

### Example 3: Compound component with Context

<DemoLink to="/compound-component/preview/tabs">View Demo</DemoLink>

By leveraging React context, we can provide the necessary states and functions to child components without exposing them through props, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.

<TabsDoc />
<div style={{ height: 300 }} />
