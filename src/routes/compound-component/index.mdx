# Compound Components

This document provides an explanation and examples of using compound components in React. Compound components are a design pattern
where related child components are encapsulated within a parent component to create a reusable and flexible component suite.

This pattern enhances customization and simplifies the internal composition of components.

## Importance of the Pattern

Compound components are important for several reasons:

- **Encapsulation and Reusability:** They allow encapsulating related components, making the parent component more reusable and modular.

- **Customizability:** Each child component can be individually customized without exposing numerous customization props through the parent component.

- **Simplicity in State Management:** A well-designed compound component should require minimal state management, making the component easier to understand and maintain.

## Use-Cases and Examples

### Example 1: `<select>` and `<option>` in HTML

A similiar example in HTML are the `<select>` and `<option>` tags:

    ```html select.html
        <select>
            <option value="pizza">Pizza</option>
            <option value="sushi">Sushi</option>
            <option value="soup">Soup</option>
        </select>
    ```

The select tag works together with the option tag which is used for a drop-down menu to select items in HTML. Here the `<select>` manages the state of the UI, then the `<option>` elements are configured on how the `<select>` should work.

### Example 2: Building a compound component

<DemoLink to="/compound-component/preview/breadcrumbs">View Demo</DemoLink>

E-commerce websites often have “breadcrumbs” to help the user navigate to parent/grand-parent pages. For example:

    `Electronics / Cell Phones / Cases`

---

<BreadcrumbDoc />
<div style={{ height: 100 }} />

### Example 3: Compound component with Context

<DemoLink to="/compound-component/preview/tabs">View Demo</DemoLink>

By leveraging React context, we can provide the necessary states and functions to child components without exposing them through props, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.

<TabsDoc />
<div style={{ height: 300 }} />
