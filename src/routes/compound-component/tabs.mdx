    ```tsx Tabs.tsx focus=5
    // from ./_components/Tabs.tsx
    ````

    If we want to pass props to different components and avoid prop drilling, we will need to set up a [React context](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks#context-hooks) object for providing states managed at the parent level to all children components.

    ---

    ```tsx Tabs.tsx focus=7:15
    // from ./_components/Tabs.tsx
    ````

    This component is essentially a wrapper that exposes the active tab state and the function that allow us to change the active tab. The context provider acts as the wrapper. So now all the children inside this container can access the activeTab and the setter function using the useContext hook.

    ---

    ```tsx Tab.tsx
    // from ./_components/Tab.tsx
    ````

    Then let’s add the tab component. This is the button that’ll help us to switch between sections.
    On clicking this button, it triggers the `changeTab` from the context changing the `activeTab state. Any other component that’s accessing this state will be re-rendered.

    ---

    ```tsx TabPanel.tsx
    // from ./_components/TabPanel.tsx
    ````

    And finally, the actual tab section. Based on the activeTab from the context, we display the specific tab section.

    ---

    ```tsx Tabs.tsx focus=2:3,17:19
    // from ./_components/Tabs.tsx
    ````

    Now we can default export the tabs component and attach the other sub-components to this component.

    ---

    ```tsx TabsExample.tsx
    // from ./_components/TabsExample.tsx
    ````
    Inside the TabsExample file, let’s import all our tab components and use them as we please.

    Note: We can add any other elements we want like the `div`. We can also use a completely different arrangement of the elements.
