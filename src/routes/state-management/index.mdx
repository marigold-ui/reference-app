In React, **state refers to any data that represents the current behavior of an application**. Examples include a list of objects fetched from the server, which item is currently selected, the name of the currently logged-in user and whether a modal is open.

**State Management is the process of handling changes to state over time**. This involves:

- Storing an initial value
- Reading the current value
- Updating a value

React applications determine what UI to render based on the current state values. Thus, understanding when and how to use different techniques for managing state is a crucial skill for all React developers, as is deciding where a given piece of state should live.

For a comprehensive approach to state management, it's important to consider:

1. **Local State:** This is state that is managed within a single component. It's ideal for state that doesn't need to be shared across multiple components.
2. **Global State:** This is state that needs to be accessible by multiple components throughout the application. Tools like Redux or Context API can be used to manage global state.
3. **Server Cache:** This involves state that represents data fetched from a server. Unlike UI state, server cache should be managed differently, often using tools like React Query or SWR to handle data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the server.

By effectively managing local state, global state, and server cache, you can create a React application that is both efficient and easy to maintain.

### Let's break down the state management code example:
