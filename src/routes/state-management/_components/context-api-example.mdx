        ````

        ### Create the context

        First, we need to create the context. The only argument to createContext is the `default` value.

        ---

        ```tsx ContextApiExample.tsx focus=36:38
        // from ./ContextApiExample.tsx
        ````

        ### Use the context
        To read the value from the context `CategoryContext` we can use the hook `useContext`.
        This tells React that the ProductList component wants to read the CategoryContext.

        Than we can use our variable, e.g. for filtering products.

        ---

        ```tsx ContextApiExample.tsx focus=16,18
        // from ./ContextApiExample.tsx
        ````

        ### Provide the context
        As final step we need to provide it because until now React doesn't know where to get it.

        We need to find the highest component in our tree which uses category and than we just need to wrap this component with a context provider so all children will have access to this Context.

        This tells React: `if any component inside this ProductPage asks for CategoryContext, give them this category.`


        <Message messageTitle='Note'>
            If we don’t provide the context, React will use the default value we’ve specified in the first step.
