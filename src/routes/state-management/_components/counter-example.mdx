        ### Storing an Initial Value

        Local state is typically initialized using the `useState` hook. This hook takes an initial state value as an argument and returns an array containing the current state and a function to update it.

        **0** is the initial value for the count state on the first render.

        ---

        ```tsx CounterExample.tsx focus=10
        // from ./CounterExample.tsx
        ````

        ### Reading the Current State Value

        The current state value can be read directly from the state variable returned by useState. This state value can then be used in the component's JSX to dynamically render content.
        This will display the current value of `count` in the UI.

        ---

        ```tsx CounterExample.tsx focus=9
        // from ./CounterExample.tsx
        ````

        ### Updating a State Value
        To update the state, we use the state update function (in this case, `setCount`). This function takes the new state value as an argument and triggers a re-render of the component with the new state.

        When clicking the button `onPress` it will call the `setCount` function which updates the `count` state by adding 1 to its current value.
