        ### Storing an initial value

        Here we hold two local states. `searchQuery` is for saving the current input value. `filteredList` holds all filtered movies based on the `searchQuery`.

        ```tsx SearchFilterComponent.tsx focus=52:57
        // from ./SearchFilterComponent.tsx
        ````

        ### Reading the current state value

        `filteredList` has the current data based on the `searchQuery`. Initially it shows all available movies loaded from the API.

        ```tsx SearchFilterComponent.tsx focus=27:34,47:51
        // from ./SearchFilterComponent.tsx
        ````

        ### Updating a state value
        From our `SearchField` we trigger an onChange event which updates the state variable which is hold by `searchQuery` (also known as [`controlled input`](https://www.marigold-ui.io/patterns/building-forms?theme=core#controlled-or-uncontrolled-components)).

        Also `filteredList` will be updated via the state update function `setFilteredList` which only holds the filtered values. Both triggers a re-render of the component which updates the UI based on these updated values.
