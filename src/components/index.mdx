# Welcome to the React Reference App
The React Reference App is a resource designed to provide you with practical examples of various coding patterns and practices, mainly in <b>ReactJS</b>.
It serves as a reference point for you to understand, learn, and implement these patterns in your own projects.

Patterns are a way of organizing code in a way that makes it easier to understand, maintain, and extend. They are a set of best practices that have been proven to work well in a variety of situations.
In the end, patterns are like blueprints that can solve recurring problems and challenges.

The main purpose of this app is to provide an overview of the most common patterns and practices in ReactJS using simple examples.
Specific issues or challenges, such as managing state, handling forms will be addressed. These are also shown in conjunction with the <b>Marigold Design System</b> in appropriate places.
