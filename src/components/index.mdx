So that the app feels more familiar to you, you can propose good examples from your code we can use, or you think
some of your code could be a good candidate to transform into a specific pattern please let us [know](https://www.marigold-ui.io/introduction/get-in-touch?theme=b2b#introduction-to-marigold).
