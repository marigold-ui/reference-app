      </h1>
      

      <p>
        The Reference-App is a resource designed to provide you with practical examples of various coding patterns and practices.
It serves as a reference point for you to understand, learn, and implement these patterns in your own projects.
      </p>
      

      <div
        class="h-5"

      </h2>
      

      <p>
        Using the Reference-App is straightforward. Each pattern or practice is presented with a detailed explanation and code examples.
You can copy these code examples directly into your own projects. To do this, simply click the copy button in the code snippet.
Clicking this button will copy the code to your clipboard, ready to be pasted into your own code editor.
      </p>
      

      <div

      <h2>
        Why these patterns?
      </h2>
      

      <p>
        The patterns are selected from our survey we made. So in future we will try to add all of them.

      <p>
        So that the app feels more familiar to you, you can propose good examples from your code we can use, or you think
some of your code could be a good candidate to transform into a specific pattern please let us
