# Compound components in React

A compound component is one of the advanced patterns of React. They help developers build more expressive and flexible APIs to share state and logic within components.
Compound components can be said to be a pattern that encloses the state and the behavior of a group of components but still gives the rendering control of its variable parts back to the external user.

## When should you make use of compound components?

You should make use of compound components when you want to:

- Solve issues related to building reusable components

- Development of highly cohesive components with minimal coupling

- Better ways to share logic between components

## HTML example

A similiar example in HTML are the `<selected>` and `<option>` tags:

    ```html select.html
        <select>
            <option value="pizza">Pizza</option>
            <option value="sushi">Sushi</option>
            <option value="soup">Soup</option>
        </select>
    ```

The select tag works together with the option tag which is used for a drop-down menu to select items in HTML. Here the `<select>` manages the state of the UI, then the `<option>` elements are configured on how the `<select>` should work.
