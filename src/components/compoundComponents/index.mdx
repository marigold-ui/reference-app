# Compound components in React

React compound component is a powerful pattern that allows you to create reusable and flexible components by encapsulating related child components within a parent component. The idea behind compound components is to provide a clean and intuitive API for users to interact with your component while keeping the implementation details hidden.

Think of compound components as a Lego set. Each individual Lego block within the set may have its own shape, colour, and purpose, but when you combine them together in a specific way, you can build something much more complex and exciting.

We build a suite of reusable components and place them wherever we want based on our convenience. If you don’t want a specific part, you just remove it without adding any logic. This brings in a lot of flexibility from a devs perspective and scaling the component now becomes much easier.

This design approach leads to the following benefits:

- It is easy to customize child components. We no longer have to expose customization props through the parent component, each child component may be individually customized.

- When using a react compound component, it is easy to understand what’s the internal composition of the parent component set.

- A well-designed React compound component should have very little state management required.

<div className="h-5" />

## HTML example

A similiar example in HTML are the `<select>` and `<option>` tags:

    ```html select.html
        <select>
            <option value="pizza">Pizza</option>
            <option value="sushi">Sushi</option>
            <option value="soup">Soup</option>
        </select>
    ```

The select tag works together with the option tag which is used for a drop-down menu to select items in HTML. Here the `<select>` manages the state of the UI, then the `<option>` elements are configured on how the `<select>` should work.

<div className="h-5" />

## Example 1: Building a compound component

<DemoLink destination="/compoundComponent/preview/BreadcrumbsExample">View Demo</DemoLink>

E-commerce websites often have “breadcrumbs” to help the user navigate to parent/grand-parent pages. For example:

    `Electronics / Cell Phones / Cases`

---

<BreadcrumbDoc />
<div style={{ height: 100 }} />

## Example 2: Compound component with Context

<DemoLink destination="/compoundComponent/preview/TabsExample">View Demo</DemoLink>

By leveraging React context, we can provide the necessary states and functions to child components without exposing them through props, resulting in a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.

<TabsDoc />
<div style={{ height: 300 }} />
