    ```tsx BreadcrumbsExample.tsx

        import React from 'react';

        import Breadcrumbs from './Breadcrumbs';

        function App() {
            // TODO: Replace this:
            return (
                <nav aria-label="Breadcrumbs">
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <a href="/">Electronics</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="/cellphones">Cell Phones</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="/cellphones/cases" aria-current="page">
                                Cases
                            </a>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </nav>
            );
        }

        export default App;

    ```

    E-commerce websites often have “breadcrumbs” to help the user navigate to parent/grand-parent pages. For example:

    `Electronics / Cell Phones / Cases`

    Let's imagine we have the following code for these breadcrumbs (see BreadcrumbsExample.tsx).

    How we can built now a compound component?

    Looking at the markup, it seems like we'll need two components:

    * A Breadcrumbs parent wrapper to contain the group

    * A Crumb component for each link in the group

    ---

    Copy the chunk for the parent wrapper (Breadcrumbs) and made it generic.

    ```tsx Breadcrumbs.tsx focus=4:10
    // from ./Breadcrumbs.tsx
    ```

    ---

    Copy the chunk for each link in the group (Crumb) and made it generic.

    ```tsx Breadcrumbs.tsx focus=12:23
    // from ./Breadcrumbs.tsx
    ```

    ---

    ## Connect the components

    As final step we need to connect these components

    ```tsx Breadcrumbs.tsx focus=33
    // from ./Breadcrumbs.tsx
    ```

    One of the weird things about JS is that functions can have properties.
    It's weird, but functions are like objects in this way. We can "hang" data on them, like clothes hung on a clothesline.

    ---

    ## Update BreadcrumbsExample.tsx

    Finally we can use this compound component in our BreadcrumbsExample.tsx.



    ```tsx BreadcrumbsExample.tsx
    // from ./BreadcrumbsExample.tsx
    ```

    ---

    Note that we only need to import the `Breadcrumbs` component.

    ```tsx BreadcrumbsExample.tsx focus=1,6,12
    // from ./BreadcrumbsExample.tsx
    ```

    ---

    Because we connect `Crumb` to `Breadcrumbs` we can access it as property.

    ```tsx BreadcrumbsExample.tsx focus=7:18
    // from ./BreadcrumbsExample.tsx
    ```
