    ```tsx BreadcrumbsExample.tsx

        import React from 'react';

        import Breadcrumbs from './Breadcrumbs';

        function App() {
            return (
                <nav aria-label="Breadcrumbs">
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <a href="/">Electronics</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="/cellphones">Cell Phones</a>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <a href="/cellphones/cases" aria-current="page">
                                Cases
                            </a>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </nav>
            );
        }

        export default App;

    ```

    Let's imagine we have the following code for these breadcrumbs (see BreadcrumbsExample.tsx).

    How we can built now a compound component?

    Looking at the markup, it seems like we'll need two components:

    * A `Breadcrumbs` parent wrapper to contain the group

    * A `Crumb` component for each link in the group

    ---

    Copy the chunk for the parent wrapper (`Breadcrumbs`) and made it generic.

    ```tsx Breadcrumbs.tsx focus=3:9
    // from ./Breadcrumbs.tsx
    ```

    ---

    Copy the chunk for each link in the group (`Crumb`) and made it generic.

    ```tsx Breadcrumbs.tsx focus=11:31
    // from ./Breadcrumbs.tsx
    ```

    ---

    As final step we need to connect these components.

    ```tsx Breadcrumbs.tsx focus=34
    // from ./Breadcrumbs.tsx
    ```

    We can call it weird or awesome, but JS functions can have properties.
    Functions are like objects in this way. We can "hang" data on them, like clothes hung on a clothesline.

    ---

    Finally we can use this compound component in our BreadcrumbsExample.tsx.

    ```tsx BreadcrumbsExample.tsx
    // from ./BreadcrumbsExample.tsx
    ```

    ---

    Note that we only need to import the `Breadcrumbs` component.

    ```tsx BreadcrumbsExample.tsx focus=1,6,12
    // from ./BreadcrumbsExample.tsx
    ```

    ---

    Because we connect `Crumb` to `Breadcrumbs` we can access it as a property.

    ```tsx BreadcrumbsExample.tsx focus=6:12
    // from ./BreadcrumbsExample.tsx
    ```
